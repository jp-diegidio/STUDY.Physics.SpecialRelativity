## **Physics case studies: Special Relativity**

This is an **open project**: collaborations, suggestions, corrections,
as well as issues and pull requests are all very welcome.

## Overview

This repository collects the following case studies:

- **Inertial Frames** version 1.1.0  
  Bob and Alice pass by each other collinearly at a relative constant speed.  
  They reset their clocks to zero at the moment they are colocated.  
  - [Interactive diagrams](https://jp-diegidio.github.io/STUDY.Physics.SpecialRelativity/home/InertialFrames/App/index.html)
  - [Mathematical analysis](https://jp-diegidio.github.io/STUDY.Physics.SpecialRelativity/home/InertialFrames/Docs/sr.inertial.md)
  - [Source code](https://github.com/jp-diegidio/STUDY.Physics.SpecialRelativity/blob/master/home/InertialFrames)

More case studies are planned, next in line being the Twin Paradox.
