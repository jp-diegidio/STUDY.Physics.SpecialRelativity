## **Physics case studies: Special Relativity**

This is an **open project**: collaboration is welcome.

## Overview

This repository collects the following case studies:

- **Inertial Frames** version 1.1.0  
  Bob and Alice pass by each other collinearly at a relative constant speed.  
  They reset their clocks to zero at the moment they are colocated.  
  - [Formal analysis](https://jp-diegidio.github.io/STUDY.Physics.SpecialRelativity/content/InertialFrames/doc.html)
  - [Interactive diagram](https://jp-diegidio.github.io/STUDY.Physics.SpecialRelativity/content/InertialFrames/app.html)
  - [Source code](https://github.com/jp-diegidio/STUDY.Physics.SpecialRelativity/blob/master/content/InertialFrames)

More studies are planned, up to the Twin Paradox.
