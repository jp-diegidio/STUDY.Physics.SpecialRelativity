## The game

Bob and Alice pass by each other collinearly at a relative constant speed.  
They reset their clocks to zero at the moment they are colocated.

## The outcome

The space-time diagrams make concrete the *clock hypothesis*, i.e. proper time
as **absolute time**, recovering absolute time as the fundamental dynamic
variable, and with it the relativistic symmetry of the frame perspectives.

The diagrams also show that, relative to any frame of reference, any particle
moves into the future and in space at a speed that is *faster than measured*
in that frame (i.e. in a plane of simultaneity) by exactly its Lorentz factor.
And this already and essentially is **time travel**.

In particular, the 4-velocity of light in any frame of reference is (scalarly)
**infinite** in all components, its magnitude being exactly the *measured light*
*speed* times its Lorentz factor (see [the formal analysis] for details).
